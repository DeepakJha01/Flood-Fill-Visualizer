# FloodFillVisualizer
This is a Flood-Fill Algorithm Visualizer. This algorithm is mainly used to determine the bounded area connected to a given node in a multi-dimensional array.<br>
In this project, this algorithm is used to fill color inside an area surrounded with multi-color boundary.<br>
Flood-Fill Algorithm has two approaches<br>
1. 4 connected approach<br>
2. 8 connected approach
<br>
Here, 4 connected approach is implemented here.
